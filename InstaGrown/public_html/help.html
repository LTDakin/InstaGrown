      <p> This social networking site is a place for plant-enthusiasts to share
        pictures, post advice, and bond over their shared love of plants and
        related hobbies.
      </p>
      <p>The login page allows a user to login with their credentials. If
        the user does not have an account, they can click a button to go
        to the account creation page.
      </p>
      <p>The account creation page allows a user to create a new account on
        InstaGrown. The user will be prompted for information. When the user
        submits the form, if the username for their new account is not already
        taken, their new account will be created.
      </p>
      <p>The home page has multiple sections. At the top, the user can search
        for users or posts (via a menu) that have a keyword. The results of this
        search will be shown to the user in the center menu. If a user is searched,
        the user has the option to add that user to their friends list. If a
        post is searched, the user can share, like, or comment on the post.
      </p>
      <p>If the user does not search for anything, posts from the user and other users will be displayed
        in the center. The posts are displayed with the most recent posts at the
        top. Posts can be liked only once by a user, but a user can leave
        as many comments as they desire on a post. Sharing a post creates a
        new post with the same content as the shared post at the top of the
        post feed.
      </p>
      <p>
        On the left side of the homepage, a friends list is shown. A user
        can send messages to their friends by clicking on the message button located
        with the friend. Friends profiles can also be viewed with the appropriate button.
        The right side of the screen contains the user's information.
        There is also a button to update the user's information (ie status).
        At the top right, there is a button that allows a user to create posts.
        It asks for post content and the username, then the post is created and
        can be seen in the user's feed.
